# tslib-seed
This is a basic seed for typescript library, includes tsconfig, tslint, package.json with all dependencies needed to build, lint and test the library. And gulp files with implementations for these tasks.
Also includes most basic and widely used functions in src/tools lib, to avoid referencing huge lodash lib if you only need flatMap.
